## Conway's Game of Life

Before you create your first grid planet
In this simulation, there is one rule: A cell must have enough neighbors to stay alive!

- If a cell is alive and has two or three neighbors alive, that cell lives to the next generation.
- If a cell is dead and has exactly three neighbors alive, that cell comes to life.
